/**
 * Class that extends the Graph Collection Writter to write graphs in PAFI 
 * format. In PAFI we don't need to save the collection in separated files, 
 * as PAFI associates each occurrence of a pattern with the transaction 
 * (substructure). For example, if a pattern appears twice in a graph, it will 
 * only count as one.
 * 
 * The full graphToFile method is not extended because it will be deprecated.
