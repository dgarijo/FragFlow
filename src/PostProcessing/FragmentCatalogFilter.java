     * Method that takes the filteredMultiStepFragments, (initialized

     * relevant. The rationale followed here is that if a fragment includes other 
     * fragments that occur the same number of times, those included fragments 
     * ought to be removed.
     * For example: Fragment 1 occurs 3 times, Fragment 2 occurs 4 times and 
     * Fragment 4 occurs 3 times). Fragment 2 and 1 are included in Fragment 4.
     * Since Fragment 1 occurs the same number of times as Fragment 4, we don't
     * consider significant (4 is the same but bigger). However Fragment 2 is not
     * removed, as has occurred more times (it means that it has been found outside 
     * fragment 4).
     * 
     * We assume that both catalogToFilter and its occurrences have been previously initialized.
     * @param catalogToFilter fragment catalog to be filtered.
     * @param occurrencesOfCatalogToFilter total number of occurrences of the fragment catalog
     * @return the number of occurrences of the filtered fragment catalog
