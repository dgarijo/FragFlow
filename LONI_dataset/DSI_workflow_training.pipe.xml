REPRODUCTION,  AND DISPLAY OF THE SOFTWARE.

10.        Independent Status.  Neither the making of this Agreement nor the 
performance of its provisions shall be construed to constitute any Party 
an agent, employee or legal representative of the other Party for any 
purpose whatsoever.

11.        Use of Name.  Except as expressly provided in this Agreement or 
pursuant to specific prior written permission of the applicable party, 
Licensee shall not use any of the names, logos or trademarks, or any

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the license granted under this Agreement 
does not constitute a response by Licensee to any request for proposals, 
bid solicitation or other invitation or offer to contract by any 
governmental authority but instead constitutes an offer to enter into a 
license agreement only upon the terms set forth herein.  If the U.S. 
Government or any other governmental authority shall seek to acquire the 
Software and its acquisition of such Software would result in the U.S. 
Government or such other governmental authority having rights in the 
Software that are at variance with the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement and license, Licensee shall not be bound by any such rights 
unless it shall have expressly entered into an amendment of this Agreement

governmental rules or regulations, including the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement.

13.        General.  This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of 
the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, superseding and 
merging any prior oral or written understandings between the Parties with 
respect thereto.  Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall 
survive any termination of this Agreement.  This Agreement may be modified 
or amended only in a writing signed by duly authorized representatives of 
the Parties hereto.  If any part of this Agreement is adjudged to be 
invalid or unenforceable, the Parties intend that such invalidity shall 
not affect any other provision hereof.  Any waiver or failure of any Party 
to assert a right hereunder shall not constitute a waiver or excuse a 
similar failure in any other circumstance.  Licensee shall not assign any 
of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior 
written consent of Licensor.  Except to the extent prohibited by law or 
regulation, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, excluding 
its provisions with respect to conflict of laws, and each Party consents 
to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Boston, Massachusetts 
in all disputes relating to this Agreement.  Headings in this Agreement 
are for convenience only and are not intended to be used to interpret or 
construe this Agreement.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts 
and delivered by facsimile with the same effect as an original.  Each of 
the undersigned represents that such individual is duly authorized to

Licensor does not guarantee the accuracy of the Software, or of any 
results or data, and assumes no obligation to notify Licensee of any bug 
fixes, enhancements or other modifications that may be made to the 
Software.  LICENSOR SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

9.        Limitation of Liability; Indemnification.  IN NO EVENT SHALL 
LICENSOR OR ANY OF ITS TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, MEDICAL OR 
PROFESSIONAL STAFF, EMPLOYEES, STUDENTS OR  AGENTS ("LICENSOR'S

INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY 
THEORY OF LIABILITY ARISING IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE OR THIS 
AGREEMENT, EVEN IF LICENSOR OR ANY OF LICENSOR'S PERSONNEL HAS BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT 
PROHIBITED BY LAW OR REGULATION, LICENSEE ASSUMES ALL LIABILITY FOR 
LICENSEE'S USE, REPRODUCTION,  AND DISPLAY OF THE SOFTWARE, AND AGREES TO

REPRODUCTION,  AND DISPLAY OF THE SOFTWARE.

10.        Independent Status.  Neither the making of this Agreement nor the 
performance of its provisions shall be construed to constitute any Party 
an agent, employee or legal representative of the other Party for any 
purpose whatsoever.

11.        Use of Name.  Except as expressly provided in this Agreement or 
pursuant to specific prior written permission of the applicable party,

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the license granted under this Agreement 
does not constitute a response by Licensee to any request for proposals, 
bid solicitation or other invitation or offer to contract by any 
governmental authority but instead constitutes an offer to enter into a 
license agreement only upon the terms set forth herein.  If the U.S. 
Government or any other governmental authority shall seek to acquire the 
Software and its acquisition of such Software would result in the U.S. 
Government or such other governmental authority having rights in the 
Software that are at variance with the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement and license, Licensee shall not be bound by any such rights 
unless it shall have expressly entered into an amendment of this Agreement

the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, superseding and 
merging any prior oral or written understandings between the Parties with 
respect thereto.  Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall 
survive any termination of this Agreement.  This Agreement may be modified 
or amended only in a writing signed by duly authorized representatives of 
the Parties hereto.  If any part of this Agreement is adjudged to be 
invalid or unenforceable, the Parties intend that such invalidity shall 
not affect any other provision hereof.  Any waiver or failure of any Party 
to assert a right hereunder shall not constitute a waiver or excuse a 
similar failure in any other circumstance.  Licensee shall not assign any 
of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior 
written consent of Licensor.  Except to the extent prohibited by law or 
regulation, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, excluding 
its provisions with respect to conflict of laws, and each Party consents 
to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Boston, Massachusetts 
in all disputes relating to this Agreement.  Headings in this Agreement 
are for convenience only and are not intended to be used to interpret or 
construe this Agreement.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts 
and delivered by facsimile with the same effect as an original.  Each of 
the undersigned represents that such individual is duly authorized to

trustee, director, officer, staff member, employee, student or agent 
thereof, or of any funding agency, in any advertising, promotional or 
sales material or publicity or in any document employed to obtain funds or 
financing, or to endorse or promote research results or products produced 
in whole or in part by operation of the Software or derived from or based 
on the Software.  Such permission shall be obtained from Licensor's Chief 
Public Affairs Officer.  Licensee hereby grants permission to Licensor to 
use Licensee's name for purposes of obtaining funds from any funding

12.        U.S. Government Rights.  For Software supported by federal 
funding, the license granted under this Agreement is subject to the 
rights, conditions and limitations imposed by U.S. law including without 
limitation 35 U.S.C. § 202 et seq. and regulations pertaining thereto. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the license granted under this Agreement 
does not constitute a response by Licensee to any request for proposals, 
bid solicitation or other invitation or offer to contract by any 
governmental authority but instead constitutes an offer to enter into a 
license agreement only upon the terms set forth herein.  If the U.S. 
Government or any other governmental authority shall seek to acquire the 
Software and its acquisition of such Software would result in the U.S. 
Government or such other governmental authority having rights in the 
Software that are at variance with the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement and license, Licensee shall not be bound by any such rights 
unless it shall have expressly entered into an amendment of this Agreement 
that shall set forth such rights in accordance with any applicable 
governmental rules or regulations, including the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement.

13.        General.  This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of 
the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, superseding and 
merging any prior oral or written understandings between the Parties with 
respect thereto.  Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall 
survive any termination of this Agreement.  This Agreement may be modified 
or amended only in a writing signed by duly authorized representatives of 
the Parties hereto.  If any part of this Agreement is adjudged to be 
invalid or unenforceable, the Parties intend that such invalidity shall 
not affect any other provision hereof.  Any waiver or failure of any Party 
to assert a right hereunder shall not constitute a waiver or excuse a 
similar failure in any other circumstance.  Licensee shall not assign any 
of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior 
written consent of Licensor.  Except to the extent prohibited by law or 
regulation, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, excluding 
its provisions with respect to conflict of laws, and each Party consents 
to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Boston, Massachusetts 
in all disputes relating to this Agreement.  Headings in this Agreement 
are for convenience only and are not intended to be used to interpret or 
construe this Agreement.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts 
and delivered by facsimile with the same effect as an original.  Each of 
the undersigned represents that such individual is duly authorized to 
execute this Agreement.
