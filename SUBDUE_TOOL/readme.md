This folder contains all the related contents of the SUBDUE tools:

* All the binary files for the execution in a .rar (they will have to be extracted in a "bin" folder in order to make the .bats work properly),
* the input graphs.
* the tests I have been doing
* the results.

Note: some of the paths of the .bats may have local paths to my computer. There are scripts for generating them appropriately in the main code.
