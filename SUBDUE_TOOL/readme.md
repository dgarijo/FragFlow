SUBDUE Tool
===========
This folder contains all the related contents of the SUBDUE tool:

* All the binary files for the execution in a .rar (they will have to be extracted in a "bin" folder in order to make the .bats work properly),
* some of the input graphs I have used on my research.
* some of the tests I have been doing
* the results from the previous tests and input graphs.
* the SUBDUE source code modified to produce a additional statistics. This is later used for filtering the fragments by FragFlow

Dependencies: The SUBDUE executable file has been made with the Netbeans c/c++ compiler. In order to make your own installation it is recommended to compile the sources and build them.
