This folder contains all the related contents of the SUBDUE tools:

* All the binary files for the execution in a .rar (they will have to be extracted in a "bin" folder in order to make the .bats work properly),
* the input graphs.
* the tests I have been doing
* the results.
* the SUBDUE source code modified

Dependencies: The SUBDUE executable file has been made with the Netbeans c/c++ compiler. 
I have been having problems with the binaries I created (they seem to work ok on one computer but won't work on others). Thus it is recommended to compile the sources and build them.
